The four seasons of the year are beautiful and pleasant. Summer is the most colourful season. There are a lot of flowers at this time. It is the best time to travel, to spend several weeks at the seaside or in a village. Autumn brings all kinds of fruits and vegetables. We may also enjoy some warm and pleasant days in September. Winter covers everything with glittering snow. Making a snowman and playing snowballs are among hobbies of many children and grown-ups. But everything and everyone waits impatiently for spring. Spring is the favourite season for many people.
